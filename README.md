# McQuarriedShared
 A series of old scripts from F. McQuarrie Jr.

BDA* - These are Python scripts I'm currently writing to help analyze detection
efficiency of high-frequency transmissions.

surfacings/vemprocess - Basic examples of my old method. I have been
improving on it but it worked for what we needed, a way to quickly
(within a minute of the robot surfacing) and efficiently estimate the probable
range of detection for nearby transmissions.
